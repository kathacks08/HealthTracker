# HealthTracker

Built by Katherine and Cindy for AIHacks2

As students attending online school during this period of remote learning, we are heavily impacted by long periods of screentime with few breaks in between. This was our inspiration to create Student Health, an app designed for motivating students to take breaks and maintain their health throughout a draining online school day.

Student Health has two primary features. The first is highlighted on the home page, where the user can browse various blogs and websites with tips on maintaining mental and physical well-being. These resources are split into the following categories: food/recipes, study tips, fitness/workouts, music/playlists, meditation, and ways to stay connected with friends while socially distancing.

The second and most important feature of our app allows the program to send notifications that will show up on a page dedicated to storing them. On this page, a student has the capability to check off reminders as they appear and track their progress for the day on a progress bar at the top of the screen. If they check off 5 reminders, the progress bar will be completely filled in and they will know that they succeeded in staying healthy during school that day!

side note: if you run our code notifications will send every 60 seconds but realistically there would be more time between reminders
